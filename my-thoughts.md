# My Thoughts

## Conference trends this year

  - robotics + architecture
  - organic-inspired architecture
  - organic-inspired interactive objects & fabrication
  - projection mapping
  - public control of city lights, urban interactivity
  - micro-architecture
  - temporary architecture, ephemeral spaces

## Conference buzzwords this year

  - nature inspired
  - responds to movement
  - lights-up
  - parametrically designed
  - responds to sound
  - changes color
  - speculative
  - responds to CO2 levels
  - build empathy
  - CNC milled
  - housing
  - spatial
  - data driven
  - social media

## General things that people aren't yet doing well or at all (ie. opportunities?)

  - clear design goal, or artistic intention, in their work
  - documenting the narratives and concepts rather than just the technical details of a work
  - creating solutions to "problems" or well-defined new tools
  - sharing new tools in a perfectly open manner

## Specific "bad" things I saw

  - lots of projects with empty concepts that end-up producing empty experiences, where people simply move and lights and sounds react (ie. "gadgetry expriences")
  - Sensoree's emotion-reacting shirts, where temp & humidity sensors in your hands change the color of garment around your neck.
  - maybe 4 presentations were truly moving

## Specific "good" things I saw

  - new interfaces and interaction tools by Yusuaki Kakehi
  - small robotically-enhanced spaces by Ruairi Glynn and his students
  - growing inclination for publicly-accessible/controllable interactive urban art, and architecture
  - using interactions that are more tactile
  - fabrication quality is going up in interactive art practice (Rachel Wingfield; Nataly Gattegno/Future Cities Lab)
  - an undercurrent of critical thinking does exist (Ruairi Glynn, Mary Frank)
  - application of interactive art practice to more practical fields like medicine, rehabilitation and science

## Things to research more / future experiments

  - play more with new sensor technologies for our work?
  - how do we layer data & narratives? (even more: data, narratives, visuals & interfaces?)
  - using interactions that are more tactile
  - etc?

## People to stay close to

  - Nataly Gattegno, Future Cities Lab
  - Cyril Diagne, Lab212
  - Maria Scileppi, 72andSunny
  - Russ Rive, SuperUber

## New resources

  - [Machinic](http://www.machinic.us/), fabrication company in San Francisco, by Future Cities Lab

## Potential studio visits (for San Diego studio)

  - [72andSunny](https://www.72andsunny.com), Maria Scileppi, Los Angeles
  - Filipa Valente, speaker & interactive artist, Los Angeles
  - Future Cities Lab, Nataly Gattegno, San Francisco
  - IDEO, Aaron Soloway, Palo Alto

## Lessons to improve ourselves

  - developing a narrative by respecting the architecture, history, and current narrative already present in the piece's context
  - for design project (but not so much for art projects), have a methodology/process for producing strong concepts when starting a project, to ensure we produce meaningful and thoughtful work
  - make more prototypes, quicker prototypes (software or hardware)
  - write about our work, to improve critical thinking
  - share our methodologies, processes, projects
  - be involved in our field(s) and community more

## Was the conference worth it?

  - Yes, to be involved in the community, connect with others, get an update on the field, and get generally motivated to do better.
