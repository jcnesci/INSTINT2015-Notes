# My Thoughts

## Conference trends this year

  - robotics + architecture
  - organic-inspired architecture
  - organic-inspired interactive objects & fabrication
  - projection mapping
  - public control of city lights, urban interactivity
  - micro-architecture
  - temporary architecture, ephemeral spaces

## Conference buzzwords this year

  - nature inspired
  - responds to movement
  - lights-up
  - parametrically designed
  - responds to sound
  - changes color
  - speculative
  - responds to CO2 levels
  - build empathy
  - CNC milled
  - housing
  - spatial
  - data driven
  - social media

## General things that people aren't yet doing well or at all (ie. opportunities?)

  - clear design goal, or artistic intention, in their work
  - documenting the narratives and concepts rather than just the technical details of a work
  - creating solutions to "problems" or well-defined new tools
  - sharing new tools in a perfectly open manner

## Specific "bad" things we saw

  - lots of projects with empty concepts that end-up producing empty experiences, where people simply move and lights and sounds react (ie. "gadgetry expriences")
  - there was a lot of beautiful work that felt like it came from a kit. Bio-inspired or geometric architectural forms. Responded to generic sensor (CO2, proximity). Reacted by lighting up. A lot of these projects DID have a positive response from the audience. You have to ask yourself, what’s more important. To have work that’s well-received by passerby or work that pushes boundaries and is more conceptually interesting. Personally, we're a bit turned off by an unimaginative solution.
  - Sensoree's emotion-reacting shirts, where temp & humidity sensors in your hands change the color of garment around your neck.
  - maybe 4 presentations were truly moving

## Specific "good" things we saw

  - new interfaces and interaction tools by Yusuaki Kakehi
  - small robotically-enhanced spaces by Ruairi Glynn and his students
  - growing inclination for publicly-accessible/controllable interactive urban art, and architecture
  - using interactions that are more tactile
  - fabrication quality is going up in interactive art practice (Rachel Wingfield; Nataly Gattegno/Future Cities Lab)
  - an undercurrent of critical thinking does exist (Ruairi Glynn, Mary Frank)
  - application of interactive art practice to more practical fields like medicine, rehabilitation and science

## Thoughts on Soso's work

  - Interactivity
    - There is more of an opportunity for direct interactivity. We use Twitter, but don’t use a lot of hardware sensing tech. Obviously, it’s not always necessary to have an interactive component. BUT it should at least be something we consider. It should be on the table.
  - Actuators
    - We use a lot of name-brand hardware that is designed to last, or work in outside conditions.
    - Many of the projects at INST-INT used much cheaper and more temporary solutions. Think LED light strips + microcontroller. Cyril made his students work with 30 pixels to come up with interesting projects. Is it feasible for Soso to do some of these smaller projects? If not for money-making, for artistic cachet?
    - A lot of Soso work is longer term and we get paid decent wages for what we do. I’m not sure if there’s an opportunity to do more lower pressure “fast” projects, but it would be fun.
  - Soso Inside Jobs
    - Some of our inside jobs could be focused on exploring new sensors or lower-cost actuators. Kind of like Lightpost - we were able to slap on a Raspberry Pi and make a cool inside thing. We need to play with hardware in our inside jobs so we know what the options on the market are, their quirks and their affordances.

## Things to research more / future experiments

  - play more with new sensor technologies for our work?
  - how do we layer data & narratives? (even more: data, narratives, visuals & interfaces?)
  - using interactions that are more tactile
  - we could start using sensors more by not only using data from external sources in our work, but also by collecting data ourselves on-site, with the piece itself
  - make our Inside Jobs be tightly restricted to promote creativity, like Cyril Diagne's 30 pixel project

  - Filipa Valente, speaker & interactive artist, Los Angeles
  - Future Cities Lab, Nataly Gattegno, San Francisco
  - IDEO, Aaron Soloway, Palo Alto

## Lessons to improve ourselves

  - write about our work: to improve critical thinking, and because you need to be the one narrating your work, giving it depth, and deciding what it means
  - share as much as possible: our methodologies, processes, projects, and get/share feedback as well
  - talk about aesthetics, in addition to technology
  - make more prototypes, quicker prototypes (software or hardware)
  - developing a narrative by respecting the architecture, history, and current narrative already present in the piece's context
  - for design project (but not so much for art projects), have a methodology/process for producing strong concepts when starting a project, to ensure we produce meaningful and thoughtful work
  - be involved in our field(s) and community more

## Was the conference worth it?

  - Yes, to be involved in the community, connect with others, get an update on the field, and get generally motivated to do better.
