# My Thoughts

## Conference trends this year

  - robotics + architecture
  - organic-inspired architecture
  - organic-inspired interactive objects & fabrication
  - projection mapping
  - public control of city lights, urban interactivity
  - micro-architecture
  - temporary architecture, ephemeral spaces

## People to stay close to

  - Nataly Gattegno, Future Cities Lab
  - Cyril Diagne, Lab212
  - Maria Scileppi, 72andSunny
  - Russ Rive, SuperUber

## Bad things I saw

  - lots of projects with empty concepts that end-up producing empty experiences, where people simply move and lights and sound react
  - Sensoree's emotion-reacting shirts, where temp & humidity sensors in your hands change the color of garment around your neck.
  - maybe 4 presentations were truly moving

## Lessons to improve ourselves

  - for design project (but not so much for art projects), have a methodology/process for producing strong concepts when starting a project, to ensure we produce meaningful and thoughtful work
  - more prototypes, quicker prototypes
  - write about our work, to improve critical thinking
  - share our methodologies, processes, projects
  - be involved in our field(s) and community more

## Was the conference worth it?

  - Yes, to be involved in the community, connect with others, get an update on the field, and get generally motivated to do better.

## Things to look into more

  - ???

## New ideas for future experiments


## Potential studios to visit (close to San Diego studio)

  - Filipa Valente, speaker & interactive artist, Los Angeles
  - Future Cities Lab, Nataly Gattegno, San Francisco
  - IDEO, AaronS Soloway, Palo Alto

## Conference buzzwords this year

  - nature inspired
  - responds to movement
  - lights-up
  - parametrically generated
  - responds to sound
  - changes color
  - speculative
  - responds to CO2 levels
  - build empathy
  - CNC milled
