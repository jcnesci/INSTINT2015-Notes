## Kawandeep Virdee

  - part of company New American Public Art
  - lives in Boston
  - started with group exercise with breathing and an animating colored gradient GIF on projection. A little bit mystical/yoga-ish.
  	- goal: let's all do an actual "interactive experience" with actual PHYSICAL PEOPLE! Not on the screen!
  - is into interactive PUBLIC art, letting people access/control the space & architecture of their city
  - My criticism:
    - his pieces are very simple technically, crude/boring aesthetically, primitive/nonexistent concept... It's the thought that counts? He is indeed intent on public urban art though, good goal.

## Toni Dove

  - very personal art approach: live multimedia performances
  - artist with history and longevity
  - her work has many LAYERS of
  	- narrative
  	- visuals/video
  	- performative interface
  - she scrubs through the different types of layers with her hands, in the air, using VR interface done in Max/MSP.
  - My criticism:
    - very personal art, not much related to Soso. Very 90's video performance style, but nice.
