## Kawandeep Virdee

  - founder @ [New American Public Art](http://www.newamericanpublicart.com/), works @ Embedly, has a [blog](http://blog.whichlight.com/) where he makes cool gifs
  - lives in Boston
  - started with group exercise with breathing and an animating colored gradient GIF on projection. A little bit mystical/yoga-ish.
  	- goal: let's all do an actual "interactive experience" with actual PHYSICAL PEOPLE! Not on the screen!
  - is into interactive PUBLIC art, letting people access/control the space & architecture of their city
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - his pieces are very simple technically, crude/boring aesthetically, primitive/nonexistent concept... It's the thought that counts? He is indeed intent on public urban art though, good goal.

## Toni Dove

  - [website](http://tonidove.com/)
  - very personal art approach: live multimedia performances
  - artist with history and longevity
  - her work has many LAYERS of
  	- narrative
  	- visuals/video
  	- performative interface
  - she scrubs through the different types of layers with her hands, in the air, using VR interface done in Max/MSP.
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - very personal art, not much related to Soso. Very 90's video performance style, but nice.

## Johanna Marsal

  - works @ [Moment Factory](http://www.momentfactory.com/en)
  - MF's credo: "We do it in public"
    - goal: to recreate the communion, the social campfire
      - = the digital campfire
  - MF creates:
    1. shows (temporary)
    2. destinations (permanent, must make the audience want to come back)
  - Projects
    - Sagrada Familia projection mapping show:
      - afraid to deface that international icon
      - needed to come up with a story for the show
        - but there's ALREADY a story in the facade!
        - can't ignore, overwrite, or betray it
        - thus, ENHANCE it!
      - through research, discovered that Gaudi's ultimate dream was to add color to the facade > became part of the 'enhanced story' they developed
      - created a 'take-away' item: LED butterflies fell from sky and could take home
    - Foresta Lumina (in Coaticook), Megaphone, etc.
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - their projects are quite heavy-handed visually, not subtle
    - with some of their more commercial projects (Superbowl, etc.) the concept is lacking
    - BUT I appreciated the lessons from the Sagrada Familia project:
      - When there's already a story in the space, architecture, or context for which we are creating a piece, don't start from scratch, overwrite it, or betray it. Work with it. Research it, to enhance it.

## Ruairi Glynn

  - [website](http://www.ruairiglynn.co.uk/), director of [Interactive Architecture Lab](http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/) @ UCL/Bartlett
  - interested in robotics + behaviour + architecture:
    - letting people take control of their architecture
    - architecture that builds itself, shapes itself, finds the best shape for the situation or for best interaction
    - buildings that communicate between each other (protocols?) adapting to current situation (traffic, etc.)
  - quotes:
    - *"If you want to encourage empathy, mirroring is a great behaviour."* (on the behaviour of his project Fearful Symmetry, where a robot follows and interacts with people in a room)
    - *"Making a more physical & tactile design process of architecture..."* (on the way he conducts his teaching @ UCL, using much prototyping and building)
    - *"fabricating performance"* (on how to build something that can adapt, or perform, based on the situation)
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - one of my favourite speakers
    - fabrication quality of student work is extremely polished
    - not very related to classical architecture or building-/habitat-making
    - like his approach on:
      - how humans attribute personality to inanimate objects, even with minimal behaviour
      - how architecture should focus more on behaviour & adaptability
      - how architecture should share information about the city, the inhabitants, the flow of people
      - how architecture + robotics should not be for aesthetic or embelishment purposes only

## Yasuaki Kakehi

  - [prof @ Keio University](http://www.xlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/); currently doing stint @ Fluid Interfaces Group, MIT; founder @ [Plaplax](http://www.plaplax.com/)
  - his tendencies are:
    - creating novel ways of interacting with objects
    - magic
    - making the invisible visible
    - hidden playful worlds
  - also interested in:
    - rehabilitation
    - performance
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - one of my favourite speakers
    - focused on creating new technologies mainly, but also on creating new magic with simple tricks using old technologies
      - seems like a very Japanese approach/sensibility
    - could lead to new tech to use for our installations (build partnership?)

## Rachel Wingfield

  - founder @ [Loop.ph](http://loop.ph/)
  - arch + tech + science
  - her best employee is a SAILOR! (makes inflatable structures using traditional sail-building techniques)
  - interested in:
    - "eco-mimicry"
    - nature-inspired building techniques & power for buildings
    - generating models of architecture based on the environment (ie. software that builds structures within empty space of surrounding architecture)
    - traditional techniques from other fields applied to architecture (lace-making, sail-making, etc.)
  - quotes:
    - *"It's amazing how you can transform a neighborhood just with a plastic bag."*
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - interesting but useless?
    - useful for temporary/ephemeral architecture, events... only?
    - her research could lead to important new building techniques, maybe?
    - her work is very 'buzzwordy' ('nature-inspired', 'parametrically-generated', 'interacts using light & color', 'senses CO2 levels', 'speculative')

## Filipa Valente

  - [website](http://cargocollective.com/limilab), is architect, who likes to espace her real job (large architecture) by making small-scale spaces + people + interaction
  - interested in 'play'
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - artistically, her work is personal, beautiful peotic, subtle
    - technically, her work is simple, crude, boring
    - but I'm very impressed with all she manages to make as a single person, she's a great "maker"

## Daniel Rozin

  - [website](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/)
  - no notes
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - impressed at his ownership of his being "the mirror guy". Has accepted his lifelong artistic subject.

## Bill Washabaugh

  - founder @ [Hypersonic](http://www.hypersonic.cc/)
  - Good lesson for "When you can make anything, what do you make?
    - must narrow down the 'motif'
    - limit the scope/content to what the audience will realistically take the time to witness
    - simplify the technology to support only the content we chose
  - Good process delimitation
    1. start with sketch in Processing, to make a physical test
    2. build Prototypes after Prototypes
    3. finesse the engineering & calculations in Solid Works
    4. finally, a Long Term Test (since things go out of whack)
  - quotes:
    - *"When you can make anything, what do you make?"*
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - nice straight-forward advice and iterative process
    - transmits love & passion for beautiful, simple science and phenomena in nature, to inspire the work

## Kristin Neidlinger

  - founder @ [Sensoree](http://sensoree.com/), a sensorial clothing company
  - quotes:
    - *"I'm very excited about the future and having a living closet."* (on the future of interactive clothing)
    - *"As a designer, I'm not opposed to anything, I'm open to everything. I'm just interested in how people use the tools and things I make."* (on whether she agrees with certain uses for interactive clothing, but instead focuses on reacting to users and their needs/desires)
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - very superficial intentions and products

## Cyril Diagne

  - [website](http://cyrildiagne.com/), partner @ French studio [Lab212](http://www.lab212.org/), prof @ [ECAL Media + Interaction program](http://www.ecal.ch/en/1103/studies/bachelor/media-interaction-design/projects-workshops)
  - quotes:
    - *"It's okay to keep things small and simple."* (on how to start projects)
    - *"Share & document everything!"* (on importance of today's community and learning from others)
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - one of my favourite speakers
    - some poetic work that avoids being too LITERAL or obvious (like a lot of work seen at the conference)
    - simplicity of work can still sometimes be obvious, but with the right sensibility, that simplicity can be what allows people to hack it, appropriate it and make it their own (like for project 'Portee')

## Mary Franck

  - [website](http://www.maryfranck.net/)
  - interested in:
    - where we should position ourselves, in Art or Tech world?
    - both have Pros and Cons
    - but mostly, both have no good financial model
      - MONEY, the elephant in the room!
  - learning from Architecture (the discipline):
    - much critical discourse about our own work, together (by doing crits, etc.)
    - critique is by fellow architects, not art critics or non-practitionners
    - string connection between practice & academia
  - lessons:
    1. write about your work (critically)
    2. talk about aesthetics (don't be afraid)
    3. own your profession (be a part of it)
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - great, direct, and to-the-point talk

## Nataly Gattegno

  - is partner @ [Future Cities Lab](http://www.future-cities-lab.net/), prof @ California College of the Arts in San Francisco
  - their work is some of most similar to SOSO seen at conference
  - have a fabrication company called 'Machinic' too
  - high level of polish in their fabricated works
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - the content of their work is also very buzzwordy/trendy for these times ('nature inspired', 'speculative', 'responds to... everything', 'data driven', etc.)
    - fabrication quality of the work is top tier, still quite beautiful
    - concept quality is just alright
    - seems more 'gadget-y' and in love with tech rather than having a strong concept or intention
    - she would be a great resource since her work is similar to SOSO's

## Yael Braha

  - [website](http://www.yaelbraha.com/), now freelance in Montreal, worked @ Obscura Digital
  - now as a freelancer, creates urban interactive installations
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - aesthetically boorish, mediocre level
    - conceptually absent, no goal or intention it seems
    - projects looked on very tight budget, which doesn't help of course
    - simply in love with tech gadgetry, like many presenters at conference

## Keri Elmsly

  - [website](http://cargocollective.com/elmsly), now works @ [Second Story](http://secondstory.com/) as Creative Director
  - producer behind large interactive projects by UVA, the Drone Orchestra at the Barbican, etc.
  - is art focused, worked on performance art events
  - her motto is "It's all about love", ie. caring for who you work with and coaxing the best out of them
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - seems like tough, hard-working, honest person. No gadgetry bullshit for no purpose.
    - no real interest for SOSO, though she is important in the field and very well connected
