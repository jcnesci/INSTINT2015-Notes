## Kawandeep Virdee

  - part of company New American Public Art
  - lives in Boston
  - started with group exercise with breathing and an animating colored gradient GIF on projection. A little bit mystical/yoga-ish.
  	- goal: let's all do an actual "interactive experience" with actual PHYSICAL PEOPLE! Not on the screen!
  - is into interactive PUBLIC art, letting people access/control the space & architecture of their city
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - his pieces are very simple technically, crude/boring aesthetically, primitive/nonexistent concept... It's the thought that counts? He is indeed intent on public urban art though, good goal.

## Toni Dove

  - very personal art approach: live multimedia performances
  - artist with history and longevity
  - her work has many LAYERS of
  	- narrative
  	- visuals/video
  	- performative interface
  - she scrubs through the different types of layers with her hands, in the air, using VR interface done in Max/MSP.
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - very personal art, not much related to Soso. Very 90's video performance style, but nice.

## Johanna Marsal, Moment Factory

  - MF's credo: "We do it in public"
    - goal: to recreate the communion, the social campfire
      - = the digital campfire
  - MF creates:
    1. shows (temporary)
    2. destinations (permanent, must make the audience want to come back)
  - Projects
    - Sagrada Familia projection mapping show:
      - afraid to deface that international icon
      - needed to come up with a story for the show
        - but there's ALREADY a story in the facade!
        - can't ignore, overwrite, or betray it
        - thus, ENHANCE it!
      - through research, discovered that Gaudi's ultimate dream was to add color to the facade > became part of the 'enhanced story' they developed
      - created a 'take-away' item: LED butterflies fell from sky and could take home
    - Foresta Lumina (in Coaticook), Megaphone, etc.
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - their projects are quite heavy-handed visually, not subtle
    - with some of their more commercial projects (Superbowl, etc.) the concept is lacking
    - BUT I appreciated the lessons from the Sagrada Familia project:
      - When there's already a story in the space, architecture, or context for which we are creating a piece, don't start from scratch, overwrite it, or betray it. Work with it. Research it, to enhance it.

## Ruairi Glynn

  - director of Masters architecture programme @ UCL/Bartlett
  - interested in robotics + behaviour + architecture:
    - letting people take control of their architecture
    - architecture that builds itself, shapes itself, finds the best shape for the situation or for best interaction
    - buildings that communicate between each other (protocols?) adapting to current situation (traffic, etc.)
  - quotes:
    - *"If you want to encourage empathy, mirroring is a great behaviour."* (on the behaviour of his project Fearful Symmetry, where a robot follows and interacts with people in a room)
    - *"Making a more physical & tactile design process of architecture..."* (on the way he conducts his teaching @ UCL, using much prototyping and building)
    - *"fabricating performance"* (on how to build something that can adapt, or perform, based on the situation)
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - one of my favourite speakers
    - fabrication quality of student work is extremely polished
    - not very related to classical architecture or building-/habitat-making
    - like his approach on:
      - how humans attribute personality to inanimate objects, even with minimal behaviour
      - how architecture should focus more on behaviour & adaptability
      - how architecture should share information about the city, the inhabitants, the flow of people
      - how architecture + robotics should not be for aesthetic or embelishment purposes only

## Yasuaki Kakehi

  - prof @ Keio University; currently doing stint at Fluid Interfaces Group @ MIT; has company Plaplax
  - his tendencies are:
    - creating novel ways of interacting with objects
    - magic
    - making the invisible visible
    - hidden playful worlds
  - also interested in:
    - rehabilitation
    - performance
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - one of my favourite speakers
    - focused on creating new technologies mainly, but also on creating new magic with simple tricks using old technologies
      - seems like a very Japanese approach/sensibility
    - could lead to new tech to use for our installations (build partnership?)

## Rachel Wingfield

  - arch + tech + science
  - her best employee is a SAILOR! (makes inflatable structures using traditional sail-building techniques)
  - interested in:
    - "eco-mimicry"
    - nature-inspired building techniques & power for buildings
    - generating models of architecture based on the environment (ie. software that builds structures within empty space of surrounding architecture)
    - traditional techniques from other fields applied to architecture (lace-making, sail-making, etc.)
  - quotes:
    - "It's amazing how you can transform a neighborhood just with a plastic bag."
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - interesting but useless?
    - useful for temporary/ephemeral architecture, events... only?
    - her research could lead to important new building techniques, maybe?
    - her work is very 'buzzwordy' ('nature-inspired', 'parametrically-generated', 'interacts using light & color', 'senses CO2 levels', 'speculative')

## Filipa Valente

  - is architect, who likes to espace her real job (large architecture) by making small-scale spaces + people + interaction
  - interested in 'play'
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - artistically, her work is personal, beautiful peotic, subtle
    - technically, her work is simple, crude, boring
    - but I'm very impressed with all she manages to make as a single person, she's a great "maker"

## Daniel Rozin

  - no notes
  - __MY OPINION:__
    - impressed at his ownership of his being "the mirror guy". Has accepted his lifelong artistic subject.
